	<h2><em>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</em></h2>
	<a href= "http://www.fuseproject.com">Fuse Project</a><br>
	<a href= http://www.ideo.org>Ideo.Org</a><br>
	<p>

		I am inspired by these two websites because they are both companies that are focusing on human centered-design, specifically the motivation behind ideo.org because they are using design to improve the lives of people in developing countries. I am most interested in this intersection where design makes an impact in the lives of others. Both websites have great content and both are designed to showcase the work as the focal point. 
	</p>

	<h2><em>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</em></h2>
	<p><strong>Fuse Project</strong> uses the space of the page to emphasise the experience that they have as a company, but the images are arranged in a way that is stream-lined and easy to differentiate the differing projects. They use size of the images themselves to show a variety of content but also to demonstrate that the scope of the work that they do is both large and small. Also the way that they use type on the page, everything is labeled clearly. It strikes a balance between organized but doesn't feel formal.<br>
	<p><strong>Ideo.Org</strong> uses the space in a simplified way. While I think the logo is really underwhelming and could definitely beimproved I appreciate the simple layout in organizing lots of information. I like the balance they created with lots of whitespace and then the large video screen in the center to bring attention and focus to the projects they have created.  
	</p>

	<h2><em>What makes them similar and different?</em></h2>
	<p>They are both using white in their background and using video to add more interest on the page which makes it feel more dynamic and interactive. The ideo.org website has a very basic layout while the Fuse Project website uses a variety of columns and different layout for each page. It makes the page more dynamic, it also feels modern but not complex because it still is really organized even without a clear grid to organize the content.

	<h2><em>Thumbnail Sketches</em></h2>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Home Page Option 1</strong</li>
	<img src="option1-homepage.png">
	<li><strong>Home Page Option 2</strong</li>
	<img src="option2-homepage.png">
	<li><strong>Work Page Option 1</strong</li>
	<img src="option1-workpage.png">
	<li><strong>Work Page Option 2</strong></li>
	<img src="option2-work.png">
	<li><strong>About Page Option 1</strong></li>
	<img src="option1-aboutme.png">
	<li><strong>About Page Option 2</strong></li>
	<img src="option2-about.png">
	<li><strong>Blog Page Option 1</strong></li>
	<img src="option1-blog.png">
	<li><strong>Blog Page Option 2</strong</li>
	<img src="option2-blog.png">
	</ul>


	<p>These thumbnail sketches will reflect that the site will be heavily image driven and thus the focal point of the website will be around the images especially on the home page. On the home pages I used just one column to showcase the content since this is where I want the focus to be. On the other pages I will be using a two column grid system to separate text and image.</p>
