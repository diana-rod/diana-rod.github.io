	<h2><em>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</em></h2>
	<p> <a href= "http://www.fuseproject.com">Fuse Project</a><br>
		<a href= http://www.ideo.org>Ideo.Org</a><br>

		I am inspired by these two websites because they are both companies that are focusing on human centered-design, specifically the motivation behind ideo.org because they are using design to improve the lives of people in developing countries. I am most interested in this intersection where design makes an impact in the lives of others.

	<h2><em>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p><strong>Fuse Project</strong> uses the space of the page to emphasise the experience that they have as a company, but the images are arranged in a way that is stream-lined and easy to differentiate the differing projects. They use size of the images themselves to show a variety of content but also to demonstrate that the scope of the work that they do is both large and small. Also the way that they use type on the page, everything is labeled clearly. It strikes a balance between organized but doesn't feel formal. <br>

	<h2><em>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>They are both using white in their background and using video to add more interest on the page and it feels more dynamic and interactive.
