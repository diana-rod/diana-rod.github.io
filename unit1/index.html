	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I'm a Business Manager, living in Minneapolis {moving to Seattle}. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I've always dreamed of working in a career in design and would like to transition into a career as a Web/UX Designer.</p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>

	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a UX Designer with a company that works on projects that are driving social change  because I like to work for a company that is inspiring social change and that allows me to travel and work on projects all over the world.</p>
